# Part 3
1. The bug was that the `num1` and `num2` inputs of the `calculateSum` function were assigned to string values instead of number values, so the `result` variable in the `calculateSum` function ended up being the string concatenation of the two inputs rather than their numerical sum.
2. I would fix it by converting the two inputs `num1` and `num2` to numbers when calculating their sum. The screenshot of the fix can be found [here](/part3/bug_fix.png).
